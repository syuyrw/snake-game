# Overview

Classic snake game.

My goal with creating this program was to further my knowledge of Java. Specifically to dig deeper into classes, and functions.

This program provides the user with a graphic interface that they can use to play the game. The program takes in inputs from the keyboard to control the snake.
I also used Java to randomly place fruit on the screen, and to make it so that the snakes body follows the head, and grows every time you eat a fruit.

I used tools such as: Random, TimerTask, JPanel, javax, ArrayLists, WindowLists, and others

# Future Work

-   I need to make it so that when you collide with the wall, it results in a game over
-   I would like to make it so that a new fruit spawns quicker
-   I want to add a menu before the game starts where you can click a button
-   I want to add a countdown timer before the game starts so you aren't just thrown into it
